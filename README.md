# DigiDNA MultiSelectSearch

This project is built using **Material UI** for styling and components, **Framer Motion** for smooth animations, and **Vite** as the build tool for fast development. 

## Why These Tools

### Material UI (MUI)
Material UI was chosen because it is widely adopted for building responsive and accessible web applications, and it is used internally by the team. MUI provides a consistent design system and comes with a variety of pre-built components that significantly speed up development. It's easy to customize, extend, and integrate into any project.

### Framer Motion
Framer Motion is used to make animations smooth and visually appealing. This library simplifies creating complex animations while maintaining high performance. By using Framer Motion, I ensure that the transitions between different UI states are fluid, providing a better user experience.

### Vite
Vite is the build tool used in this project. It offers a blazing-fast development environment by using native ES modules and modern JavaScript. I chose Vite for its speed, hot module replacement (HMR), and simplicity. It helps reduce build times and improve development efficiency, allowing me to focus on writing code rather than managing complex build configurations.
